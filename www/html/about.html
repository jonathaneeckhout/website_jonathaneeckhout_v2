                Hello, my name is Jonathan Eeckhout. I am 27 years old and I come from Belgium.
                Programming embedded software is my job. I have always been very interested in technologies.
                Since I was young I wanted to know how things work. If I heard a device making a funny sound
                I would take it apart and check where this sound was comming from. Enventually fixing the
                device would give me much joy.This is why I enventually choose to become an engineer.<br>
                <br>
                I have a master degree in the industrial science with the specialization in intelligent electronics.
                In October 2015 I started working at Alcatel-Lucent (now Nokia) as a FPGA designer.
                Here I was involved in designing a FPGA chip for converting fiber signal to vdsl.
                In May 2016, I joined VeroTech as a Software/ Embedded consultant.
                My first project was at SoftAtHome as an embedded linux c developer.
                Since April 2018 I started working as an employee at SoftAtHome.
                First I developed features for the Internet of Things on a home gateway or setup boxes.
                Now I am developing networking features.<br>
                <br>
                Beside my work I develop my own projects. These projects are not limited to one specific language or target.
                With these projects I try to improve my current skills or learn new ones.
